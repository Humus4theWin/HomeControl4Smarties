Building Modules for the following devices, which can (hopefully) be controlled directly by network comands or Bluetooth.

| Device               | type                        | interface          |
|----------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------|
| Pioneer VSX 922      | AV-Receiver                 | telnet             |
| TOSHIBA 55V6763DAL   | Television                  | ??                 |
| Boho Office Easydesk | height adjustment for table | Bluetooth          |
| Philipps Hue         | Smart Lights                | Restful API/  JSON |
|                      |                             |                    |
